# OPUD
BCIT School of Transportation Project F18-013

## Introduction to Opud
Opud is a web application commissioned by Naveen Jit from the BCIT School of Transportation. It designed to be used by the customer support representative working for the School of Transportation. 

Its main function is to allow the support representative to enter customer and vehicle information into a database and create a printable repair order which will be sent to the school’s automotive shop. A technician will then fill out the repair order and give it back to the customer support representative so that the information on the tasks done to the vehicle can be entered into the database.

This application is currently a work-in-progress, and the main function still left to be implemented is the ability to add information on parts used for each repair order and to generate a printable invoice from the data on each repair order. This application is also intended to be hosted on BCIT’s own servers.
